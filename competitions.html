                <p>The University of Central Florida Annual High School Programming Tournament (UCF HSPT) is one of the club’s most beloved contests, taking place in the second week of March. The contest takes place over 4 hours, typically having 12-14 problems with solutions released shortly after the contest. The top five teams are awarded prizes, in addition to other goodies for participating.

                    Code Quest is a competition held in Lockheed Martin’s Orlando location. Code Quest is usually about 2 and a half hours and has divisions for beginner and experienced coders. The problem set is much larger than that of UCF’s, with roughly 30 problems a problem set. The problems are also ranked in order of difficulty, with harder problems awarding more points.

                    We don't know if the Stetson programming competition is happening. But if it is we will go and beat everybody ( i think).
                    “The HSPC event hosted by Stetson’s Math and Computer Science Department is a service to the local community, as well as a recruitment effort for the university,” said Eckroth. 
                    “Every participant received a Stetson scholarship, and winners received larger scholarships, as well as very valuable prizes.”

                    We don't know if the UF programming competition is happening. But if it is we will go and beat everybody ( i think).
                    We historically do very good at UF and hope that it occurs again.

                <p>The United States of America Computing Olympiad is an online competition that consists of 3 problems that must be solved over the course of 3 and a half hours. The contest can be started at any point within a 3 day window, and performing well enough warrants a promotion into the next division. Contests are held in December, January, and February.
